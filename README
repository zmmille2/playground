PROJECT IDEA 1:

I had an idea for a little plugin inspired by my natural language processing
class and by the tedium organizing my emails. How cool would it be if I could
write a program to process my emails for me, instead of me having to organize
them myself? So that's the goal of this project. I want to mark incoming emails
by comparing them to emails that I've already marked to see if I can determine
which inbox they belong in.
